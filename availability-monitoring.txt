= Availability Monitoring
The avilability monitoring toolchain consists of a number of components including

* A Monitoring Agent (sensu)
* A Monitoring Relay/proxy (rabbitmq)
* A Monitoring Controller/Server (sensu)
* An API/Presentation Layer (uchiwa)

These components and their interactions are laid out in the following diagram

== Installing the Availability Monitoring Suite
=== Installing the Monitoring Relay/Controller
Locate a bare metal system that meets the following minimum specifications

* 4GB of Memory
* Single Socket Xeon Class CPU
* 100GB of Disk Space

Do a fresh RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 basic install onto the machine. Then make sure
the following channels are available to the machine via Subscription Manager
or Satellite

 rhel-7-server-openstack-7.0-optools-rpms

First thing we will need to open the firewall on the machine to allow connections to rabbitmq and uchiwa

 firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5672/tcp --permanent
 firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=3000/tcp --permanent
 firewall-cmd --reload

Now we need to install the components needed for the monitoring server

 yum install -y sensu uchiwa redis rabbitmq-server

First we will configure rabbitmq and redis which are the backbone services. Start both redis and rabbitmq and enable them at boot

 systemctl start redis
 systemctl enable redis
 systemctl start rabbitmq
 systemctl enable rabbitmq

Now we will configure a new rabbitmq virtualhost for sensu, with a username and password combination that can access it.

 rabbitmqctl add_vhost /sensu
 rabbitmqctl add_user sensu sensu
 rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /sensu sensu ".*" ".*" ".*"

Now that the base services are running and configured, we will configure the sensu monitoring server. Edit /etc/sensu/conf.d/rabbitmq.json and add the following contents to the file

 {
   "rabbitmq": {
     "port": 5672,
     "host": "localhost",
     "user": "sensu",
     "password": "sensu",
     "vhost": "/sensu"
   }
 }

Next edit /etc/sensu/conf.d/redis.json and add the following contents to the file

 {
   "redis": {
     "port": 6379,
     "host": "localhost"
   }
 }

Finally edit /etc/sensu/conf.d/api.json and add the following contents to the file

 {
   "api": {
     "bind": "0.0.0.0",
     "port": 4567,
     "host": "localhost"
   }
 }

Now we will start and enable all sensu services

 systemctl start sensu-server
 systemctl enable sensu-server
 systemctl start sensu-api
 systemctl enable sensu-api

Finally we need to configure Uchiwa, which is the web interface for sensu. To do this we edit the file /etc/uchiwa/uchiwa.json and add the following contents to the file

 {
   "sensu": [
     {
       "name": "Openstack",
       "host": "localhost",
       "port": 4567
     }
   ],
   "uchiwa": {
     "host": "0.0.0.0",
     "port": 3000,
     "refresh": 5
   }
 }

Now we will start and enable the Uchiwa web interface

 systemctl start uchiwa
 systemctl enable uchiwa

=== Installing the Availability Monitoring Agent on all nodes
To monitor all machines in the Openstack environment, you will need to make sure the following channels are enabled in Subscription Manager/Satellite on all machines

 rhel-7-server-openstack-7.0-optools-rpms
 rhel-7-server-optional-rpms

Once this is done, you will need to install the following packages on all Openstack machines

 yum install -y sensu

Next you will need to configure sensu agent on all machines. Edit the file /etc/sensu/conf.d/rabbitmq.json on all machines to have the following content (remeber to replace $FQDN_OF_MONITORING_SERVER with the hostname or ip address of your monitoring server configured in the previous section)

 {
   "rabbitmq": {
     "port": 5672,
     "host": "$FQDN_OF_MONITORING_SERVER",
     "user": "sensu",
     "password": "sensu",
     "vhost": "/sensu"
   }
 }

Now we need to edit the file /etc/sensu/conf.d/client.json on all machines to include the following content (remember to replace $FQDN with the hostname of the machine, and $ADDRESS with the public ip address of the machine)

 {
   "client": {
     "name": "$FQDN",
     "address": "$ADDRESS",
     "subscriptions": [ "all" ]
   }
 }

Finally we need to start and enable the sensu client on all machines

 systemctl start sensu-client
 systemctl enable sensu-client

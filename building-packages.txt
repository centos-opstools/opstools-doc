Package building
================

Intro
-----

Packages are being built in [cbs](http://cbs.centos.org/koji/index), the
CentOS build system. For OpsTools, there are a few build targets available,
intended to separate content on the build side.

Build tags are named after their major package components:

  - opstools7-fluentd-012-[candidate|testing|release] for fluentd-0.12 (and related logging packages)
  - opstools7-sensu-027-[candidate|testing|release] for sensu-0.27 (and related packages) for availability monitoring
  - opstools7-perfmon-[candidate|testing|release] for performance monitoring



Testing packages
----------------

Packages tagged for -testing are being synced twice a day to
https://buildlogs.centos.org/centos/7/opstools/


Released packages
-----------------

Packages tagged for -release are being synced to
http://mirror.centos.org/centos-7/7/opstools/


Building packages
-----------------

Unfortunately, there is no SCM yet. The OpsTools SIG is collecting
spec files under the https://github.com/centos-opstools[github organization].

For building the packages on the CentOS build system, you need to become a
member of the CentOS OpsTools SIG. You need to create an account at
https://accounts.centos.org/ and apply to become a member of the
OpsTools group https://accounts.centos.org/group/view/sig-opstools .

Building is done via cbs command line tool, after the required certificate
was downloaded and saved on the local workstation

[source,bash]
centos-cert -n -u username

Check out the spec file from github, do a

[source,bash]
fedpkg --release=el7 srpm
and finally

[source,bash]
cbs build opstools7-<component>-candidate foobar.srpm



New packages
------------

New packages to OpsTools require a package review;
please upload a spec file and a SRPM to a webserver somewhere. please file a bug at
link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO&component=Package%20Review[Bugzilla]
please cc: rmeggins and mrunge

and link

  SPEC: <http location of the SPEC file>
  SRPM: <http location of the SRPM>


Use the "fedora-review" tool to create a review report and attach to the bz

If it is an existing package, then submit a review request to
`https://review.rdoproject.org/r/#/q/project:centos-opstools/$package_name`
where `$package_name` is something like rubygem-fluent-plugin-secure-forward.
